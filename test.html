   <h1>The Teton Crest Trail</h1>
   <img src="code1-4_image.png" alt="">
   <p>The Teton Crest Trail is an awe-inspiring 40-mile hike along the Grand Teton
      range in western Wyoming. The trail extends from Phillips Pass on the border
      of the Bridger Teton National Forest and proceeds north to String Lake
      in Grand Teton National Park.</p>

   <p>You can access the Teton Crest Trail from the Granite Canyon Trail or from
      the aerial tramway in Jackson Hole, which provides a gradual ascent to the
      Teton range. There are several access trails adjacent from national forest
      lands of varying degrees of difficulty.</p>

   <p>Along the trail, enjoy an exciting traverse of the Death Canyon Shelf with a difficult 
      climb over Mount Meek Pass, Hurricane Pass, and the Paintbrush Divide. This is a challenging
      3- to 4-day trip, so you must pack sufficient supplies and a water purifier. The Teton 
      Crest Trail goes through grizzly bear country, so bear spray is a must.</p>
